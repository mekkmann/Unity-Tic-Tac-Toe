# Unity-Tic-Tac-Toe
A repo for my Tic-Tac-Toe game in Unity.

Made entirely in the UI-system Unity provides because I want to expand my knowledge and understanding of it.

## About this repo
I guess this repo could be called "the start of my GameDev-journey", however, that'd be a false statement as I've already dabbled in GameDev. 

BUT, if I choose to see it for what it is; my first time publicly sharing anything GameDev-related I've done. 

Then, yes, this is the start of my journey!

## Play the game on itch.io ***(a simple way to find and share indie games online for free)***
